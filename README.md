# SaaS Dashboard Starter by StudioGrid Pro

A focused, responsive SaaS dashboard starter built with Next.js, React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

This free starter includes a complete dashboard shell, operational metrics, a Recharts visualization, recent account data, light and dark themes, and responsive navigation.

It is designed as a clean starting point for SaaS products, admin interfaces and internal tools without including the full workflows and multi-page structure of the StudioGrid Pro SaaS Dashboard Kit.

> This is a frontend starter. It does not include authentication, a database, backend APIs or payment processing.

## Themes

The starter includes light and dark themes.

Theme colors are defined in:

```text
app/globals.css
```

Theme behavior is handled by:

```text
components/theme-provider.tsx
components/dashboard/theme-toggle.tsx
```

The selected theme is stored locally in the browser and restored when the application loads again.

---

## Responsive Layout

The dashboard shell is designed for desktop, tablet and mobile layouts.

The sidebar becomes a mobile drawer on smaller screens while the main dashboard content adapts to the available width.

When customizing the interface, review it at several breakpoints rather than designing only for desktop.

---

## Customizing the Starter

Start with these files:

```text
app/(dashboard)/page.tsx
components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx
components/dashboard/topbar.tsx
components/dashboard/overview-chart.tsx
lib/dashboard-data.ts
app/globals.css
```

You can replace:

- Pampalane demo branding
- Dashboard copy
- Metrics
- Chart data
- Account data
- Activity data
- Theme colors
- Navigation content

The included demo data can be replaced with API responses, server actions, database queries or your own static data.

---

## Frontend-Only Scope

This starter provides frontend UI and browser-based demo behavior.

It does not include:

- Production authentication
- Database integration
- Backend APIs
- Payment provider integration
- Email delivery
- File storage
- Production authorization
- Real-time notification delivery

Connect the interface to the services and backend architecture used by your own application.
